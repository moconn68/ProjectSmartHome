# About

Project Smart Home, or more officially referred to as DiY Cyberphysical Systems (CPS), is our group's senior design project for our engineering capstone. The goal of this project is to create a scaled-down model of a common "cyberphysical system," or a system which contains both physical and digital components, for the purpose of cybersecurity training. While this concept has been explored before, our project takes this concept to new realms by increasing portability, functionality, educational efficacy, and wireless capability.
